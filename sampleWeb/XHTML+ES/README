Notes from submission

Reported by calestyo, Oct 25, 2010

As far as I can see the source tar-ball does currently not ship a default index website, which would make some sense IMHO, so that fresh installations have one and in order that people have a starting point on how to create their own (if they want).

The attached index.xhtml would be one with the following "features":
- valid XHTML 1.1, CSS 2.1
  therefore depending on issue #6 (http://code.google.com/p/sks-keyserver/issues/detail?id=6)
- tries to use clean and structured HTML as it's indented, no fancy graphics etc.
- seems to be quite viewable in both graphical and textual browsers
- uses little CMS and simple JavaScript for better "look and feel", both are however not necessary (e.g. if not implemented by the user agent).
- scripts are in a seperate files, to allow user agents not supporting them to not load them at all

Todos:
- scripts.txt should be named scripts.es (once issue #6 is resolved)
- the commented part is indented to be adapted by the sysadmin to their respectvie site... a note on this should be perhaps added to the readme or so.
- are there further Options/etc. that sks would understand?!


Change and/or drop the license notes as you like.

Hope you like,
Chris.

New versions of the files, adding support for "options=mr", which is however disabled for "op=get" as it's not yet implemented there (see issue #12).

"exact=on" is not in the website, as it seems to be ignored in sks. The same with "options=nm".

"clean=on" is not yet in, as I don't understand what it does.
