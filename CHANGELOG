1.1.4
  - Fix X-HKP-Results-Count so that limit=0 returns no results, but include
    the header, to let a client poll for how many results exist, without
    retrieving any. Submitted by Phil Pennock. See:
    http://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/sks-devel/2010-11/msg00015.html
  - Cleanup HTTP error and status messages.
    Submitted by Phil Pennock.
  - Add UPGRADING document to explain upgrading Berkeley DB without 
    rebuilding. System bdb versions often change with new SKS releases 
    for .deb and .rpm distros.
  - Cleanup build errors for bdb/bdb_stubs.c. Patch from Mike Doty
  - Update cryptokit from version 1.0 to 1.5 without requiring OASIS
    build system or other additional dependencies
  - build, fastbuild, & pbuild fixed to ignore signals USR1 and USR2
  - common.ml and reconSC.ml were using different values for minumimum
    compatible version. This has been fixed.

1.1.3
  - Makefile fix for 'make dep' if .depend does not exist. Issue #4
  - Makefile fix: sks and sks_add_mail fail to link w/o '-ccopt -pg'
    Issue #23
  - Added -disable_mailsync and -disable_log_diffs to sks.pod 
  - Added file extensions .css, .jpeg, .htm, .es, .js, .xml, .shtml, .xhtm,
    .xhtml and associated MIME types to server code. Part of Issue #6
  - Added sample configuration files in sampleConfig directory
  - Added sample web page files in sampleWeb directory. Issues #7, 9, 19
  - Allow requests for non-official options hget, hash, status, & clean to 
    be preceded by '-x'. Closes issues #10, 11, 13, & 14. 
  - Allow &search with long subkey ID (16 digit) and subkey fingerprint
    subkey lookup was failing with other than a short key ID. However,
    public key lookup was working with short and long key ID and fingerprints.
    This patch makes subkey lookup behave the same as full key lookup.

1.1.0:
  - Numerix has been ripped out.  OCaml's Big_int implementation is
    used instead.
  - version of Berkeley DB has been upgraded to 4.6.
  - The sks.pod file has been added to the src tarball
  - Some small changes to index view

1.0.5:
  - subkey indexing added
  - removal of most executables.  Now single "sks" executable used for almost
    everything.
  - Numerix tarball updated to include GPL notices in each file
  - SKS files updated to include GPL notices in each file
  - SKS can be configured to listen to two ports for HKP access.

1.0.3: added simple built-in webserver so that index page can be served by
       sks_db.  This should make it easier to put sks on port 80.  Also,
       sks can now be launched from any directory, as long as the -basedir
       command-line option is used to specify the location of the sks
       directory. 

1.0.2: Serious database corruption bug in fastbuild and build fixed.  Also,
       client.ml modified to avoid Yet Another Deadlock Bug.

       numerous bugfixes.
