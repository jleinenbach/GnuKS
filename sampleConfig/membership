# membership
#
# With SKS/GnuKS, two hosts can efficiently compare their databases then
# repair whatever differences are found.  In order to set up
# reconciliation, you first need to find other SKS servers that will
# agree to gossip with you. The hostname and port of the server that
# has agreed to do so should be added to this file.
#
# Empty lines and whitespace-only lines are ignored, as are lines
# whose first non-whitespace character is a `#'. Comments preceded by '#'
# are allowed at the ends of lines
#
# Example:
# keyserver.ccc-hanau.de 11370
#
# The following operators have agreed to have their peering info included in this sample file.
# NOTE: This does NOT mean you may uncomment the lines and have peers. First you must contact the
# server owner and ask permission. You should include a line styled like these for your own server.
# Until two membership files contain eact others peering info, they will not gossip.

#this.server.fdqn		11370# Your full name <emailaddress for admin purposes> 0xPreferrefPGPkey
#keyserver.ccc-hanau.de		11370# Jens Leinenbach <jens@ccc-hanau.de> 0x38D9585C
